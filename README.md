# Timber Clone
This game is part of a personal project to learn SFML and improve my skills in game design.
The game itself is not important, but the implemented code helped me a lot in understanding how to implement game mechanics, sprites, and more.
I'm still missing the timberman and the mechanics that goes along with him.
That will be done in the near future.

Developed using SFML and xcode in mac.
